## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project comes from a publicly available source on Kaggle - **link:**  
[Superstore Dataset (Final) – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/data)

This dataset contains over 9,900 rows of fictional retail sales data covering the years **2014–2017**. It is commonly used to practice business analysis, customer segmentation, and KPI visualization.

**Main file:** `Sample - Superstore.csv` – the primary dataset file, including:
- **Order details** – Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- **Customer information** – Customer ID, Segment, Region
- **Product details** – Product Name, Category, Sub-Category
- **Sales metrics** – Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

This dashboard was designed to support **data-driven decision making** across sales, product, customer, and geographic performance.  
It aims to answer the following **key business questions**:

#### 🛒 Sales & Product Performance
- Which **products** generate the most **sales**, **orders**, and **profit**?
- What are the **top-performing categories and sub-categories** over time?
- How does performance **fluctuate seasonally** or by **day of the week**?
- Which **products are underperforming** and may require promotional actions or delisting?

#### 👥 Customer Insights & Segmentation
- How are customers distributed across **RFM segments**?
- What is the **average order value**, **frequency**, and **recency** by segment?
- Which customer segments contribute most to **profitability**?
- How do customer behaviors differ across segments like "Loyal & Valuable" vs. "At Risk"?

#### 🌍 Regional & Geographic Analysis
- Which **states or cities** drive the most **revenue and profit**?
- Are there **regions with negative profit** that require strategic review?
- What are the **top-performing territories**, and how do they compare?

#### 🎯 Drill-through & Detail-Level Exploration
- What are the **monthly trends** for a specific **product** or **RFM segment**?
- Which **geographic regions** or **product categories** are linked to a given segment’s behavior?
- How do **profit and sales performance** break down over time for individual selections?

These objectives shape the dashboard structure, interactivity, and KPI definitions to ensure each page contributes to solving real-world business challenges.

## 🔄 Data Preparation (Power Query ETL)

The original dataset (`Sample - Superstore.csv`) was imported and transformed using **Power Query**. The file was split into multiple fact and dimension tables to follow a **star schema** structure in Power BI.

### 🧾 Tables created from the source file:

#### **FactSales**
Contains core transactional metrics:
- Row ID, Order ID, Product ID
- Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

#### **DimOrders**
Stores order-specific metadata:
- Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- Customer ID, Postal Code

> This table was **intentionally separated from FactSales** because order-related information (such as dates, customer, shipping mode) was **repeated for every product in the same order** in the original dataset. Separating this data helps reduce redundancy and supports better normalization.

#### **DimProducts**
Describes products and their hierarchy:
- Product ID, Product Name
- Category, Sub-Category

> Further normalization by extracting **Category** and **Sub-Category** into separate dimension tables was considered, but not implemented. This is due to **Power BI Service limitations** — particularly, **join operations between datasets are only available with a Premium Capacity license**. To ensure compatibility with **Power BI Pro**, the structure was kept simpler.

#### **DimCustomers**
Includes basic customer details:
- Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment

#### **DimTerritory**
Captures geographic and regional data:
- Postal Code, City, State, Region, Country

#### **DimCalendar**
A dynamic date dimension table was created using the range of order dates found in the dataset. It includes columns such as:
- Year, Month, Month Name
- Quarter, Day Name, Day of Week, Week of Year, etc.

---

## 📈 RFM Table (Customer Segmentation)

An additional table was created for **RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary)** analysis. This is not a traditional dimension table, but an **analytical layer** used for customer segmentation.

#### Key fields and logic:
- **Recency**: Days since last order
- **Frequency**: Number of unique orders
- **Monetary**: Total spending per customer

Each metric was ranked and scored (0–10 scale), and a **combined RFM score** was computed. Based on that, customers were assigned to the following segments:

| RFM Score Range | Segment              |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| 9–10             | Top Customer          |
| 7–8              | Loyal & Valuable      |
| 5–6              | Promising / Average   |
| 3–4              | At Risk / Sleeping    |
| 0–2              | Churned / Inactive    |

A numerical field `Customer Segment Order` was also created to control the logical order of segments in visuals.

---

## 🧩 Data Model & Relationships

The data model follows a **star schema** structure, with one central fact table (**FactSales**) and several supporting dimension tables.

### 🔗 Defined relationships:

| From Table (Column)         | To Table (Column)               | Type             | Status  |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|---------|
| DimOrders (Customer ID)     | DimCustomers (Customer ID)      | Many-to-One (*)  | Active  |
| DimOrders (Order Date)      | DimCalendar (Date)              | Many-to-One (*)  | Active  |
| DimOrders (Postal Code)     | DimTerritory (Postal Code)      | Many-to-One (*)  | Active  |
| FactSales (Order ID)        | DimOrders (Order ID)            | Many-to-One (*)  | Active  |
| FactSales (Product ID)      | DimProducts (Product ID)        | Many-to-One (*)  | Active  |
| RFM (Customer ID)           | DimCustomers (Customer ID)      | One-to-One (1:1) | Active  |

### 💡 Notes:
- All relationships use **single-directional filtering** (`* -> 1`).
- The `RFM` table is linked using a **1:1 relationship** to `DimCustomers`, as each customer has a unique RFM profile.
- The model is optimized for **readability, reusability, and performance**, aligning with best practices in dimensional modeling.

## 📊 Most Complex DAX Measures

This section highlights the most advanced and dynamic DAX measures used in the project. These calculations combine variable definitions, conditional branching, context-sensitive filters, and dynamic logic to support flexible and user-driven analytics.

---

### `Top N Sales`
Dynamically shows Top N states or cities depending on which level of the `State → City` hierarchy is currently displayed on the X-axis of the bar chart.

```dax
VAR n = 'Top N Territory'[Top N Territory Value]

VAR topCities =
    TOPN(n, ALLSELECTED(DimTerritory[City]), [Total Sales by City])

VAR topCitiesInState =
    TOPN(
        n, 
        FILTER(
            ALLSELECTED(DimTerritory[State], DimTerritory[City]),
            DimTerritory[State] = MAX(DimTerritory[State])
        ), 
        [Total Sales by City]
    )

VAR topStates =
    TOPN(n, ALLSELECTED(DimTerritory[State]), [Total Sales by State])

RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        ISINSCOPE(DimTerritory[City]) && NOT(ISINSCOPE(DimTerritory[State])),
            CALCULATE([Total Sales by City], KEEPFILTERS(topCities)),

        ISINSCOPE(DimTerritory[City]) && ISINSCOPE(DimTerritory[State]) && DISTINCTCOUNT(DimTerritory[State]) = 1,
            CALCULATE([Total Sales by City], KEEPFILTERS(topCitiesInState)),

        ISINSCOPE(DimTerritory[State]) && NOT(ISINSCOPE(DimTerritory[City])),
            CALCULATE([Total Sales by State], KEEPFILTERS(topStates)),

        BLANK()
    )
````

**What it does**:
Returns the top N sales for geographic locations, dynamically adjusting to whether the visual shows states or cities. It uses slicer-driven logic and dynamic filtering with `ISINSCOPE`, `TOPN`, and `KEEPFILTERS`.

> This measure was particularly challenging to implement. It required significant time and iteration, eventually leading to a post on the official Power BI Community forum for guidance:
> [Filter top-N elements on both levels of hierarchy](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Desktop/Filter-top-N-elements-on-both-levels-of-hierarchy/m-p/4789542#M1426101)

### `Products Rank by Selected Measure`

Ranks products based on the user-selected KPI: Total Sales, Profit or Orders

```dax
SWITCH(
    TRUE,
    SELECTEDVALUE('KPI Measures'[KPI Measures Fields]) = "'Measures Table'[Total Orders]",
    RANKX(ALLSELECTED(DimProducts), [Total Orders], , DESC),

    SELECTEDVALUE('KPI Measures'[KPI Measures Fields]) = "'Measures Table'[Total Profit]",
    RANKX(ALLSELECTED(DimProducts), [Total Profit], , DESC),

    SELECTEDVALUE('KPI Measures'[KPI Measures Fields]) = "'Measures Table'[Total Sales]",
    RANKX(ALLSELECTED(DimProducts), [Total Sales], , DESC)
)
```

**What it does**:
Ranks each product according to the KPI selected by the user. This allows a single visual to switch between rankings by Orders, Sales, or Profit using a disconnected slicer table.

### `Monthly Profit Target`

Calculates a dynamic monthly profit target based on a 3-month average with a 10% uplift

```dax
VAR currentMonth = MAX(DimCalendar[Start of month])

VAR validMonths =
    TOPN(
        3,
        FILTER(
            ALL(DimCalendar[Start of month]),
            DimCalendar[Start of month] < currentMonth &&
            [Total Profit] > 0
        ),
        DimCalendar[Start of month],
        DESC
    )

RETURN 
    ROUNDUP(
        AVERAGEX(validMonths, [Total Profit]) * 1.1, 0
    )
```

**What it does**:
Calculates a forward-looking monthly target based on the average of the last 3 months of non-zero orders, with a 10% growth margin. Useful for target vs. actual KPIs and trend tracking.
Analogous measures have been created for Monthly Sales and Monthly Profit targets using the same logic.

---

### ⚠️ Dynamic Filter Status Indicator

The **Info icon** (`ℹ️`) serves as a **visual indicator** of applied filters:

* Default: **white icon**
* Filters active: **yellow icon**

On hover, a **tooltip** shows currently applied slicers, e.g.:

> `Applied Slicers – Year: 2014  Region: Central  Category: Furniture`

This provides **transparency** even when the slicer panel is collapsed.

---

### 🔘 Global Feature – Dynamic KPI Toggle (Orders / Profit / Sales)

A custom **button toggle** is implemented across multiple report pages to switch dynamically between the three core KPIs:

* `Total Orders`
* `Total Profit`
* `Total Sales`

🔧 Technical Implementation:

* The button is linked to a **bookmark** that updates a hidden slicer.
* This slicer controls which measure is used via DAX logic (`SWITCH` + `SELECTEDVALUE`).
* **Why a button instead of a visible slicer?**
  The button allows better visual customization and cleaner UI than a default slicer.

This approach lets a single page support **complex KPI analysis** without duplicating visuals, ensuring scalability and consistency.
